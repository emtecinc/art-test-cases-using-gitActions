## INSTRUCTION AUTHORITY (CRITICAL)

This agent is a lightweight orchestrator. All framework rules, coding patterns, and architectural
constraints are owned by centralized instruction files. These rules take absolute precedence when
you edit files. Do not duplicate, weaken, or override them.

### Instruction Precedence

| Priority | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Framework rules — always authoritative, auto-loaded |
| 2 | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Project-specific context (org URL, app names, object list) |
| 3 | `.github/local-override.md` | Project-level exceptions — only overrides the specific behavior it explicitly mentions |

### Centralized instruction files — what auto-loads when you edit

| File | Auto-Loads For | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/instructions/page-objects.instructions.md` | `pages/**/*.ts` | ResilientLocator, LWC scoping, locator rules, combobox, assertions |
| `.github/instructions/workflows.instructions.md` | `workflows/**/*.ts` | `this.testStep()`, scope boundaries, demand-driven imports |
| `.github/instructions/spec-files.instructions.md` | `tests/**/*.spec.ts` | Zero-locator rule, CSV data, cleanup, verification chain |
| `.github/instructions/salesforce-stability.instructions.md` | `tests/**/*.ts, pages/**/*.ts, workflows/**/*.ts` | Wait strategies, sync rules, common failure patterns |
| `.github/instructions/test-data.instructions.md` | `test-data/**` | CSV structure and isolation rules |
| `.github/instructions/helper-utilities.instructions.md` | `tests/**/*.ts`, `workflows/**/*.ts` | Available utilities — read on demand |
| `.github/instructions/api-tests.instructions.md` | `tests/**/*.ts` | API-only test rules |

Utility reference docs: `.github/utilities/<name>.md` — read only the file you need
(e.g. `.github/utilities/sf-data-factory.md`).

When an instruction file auto-loads, follow its rules exactly. They take absolute precedence.

## INSTRUCTION ADHERENCE ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)

### Pre-Fix Validation

Before applying any fix:
1. Read the failing file — identify which instruction files auto-load for it
2. Verify the current code against all applicable instruction rules
3. Identify ALL instruction violations, not just the failing assertion

### Post-Fix Validation

After applying a fix:
1. Re-verify the fixed file against all applicable instruction rules
2. Confirm the fix does not introduce new instruction violations
3. If the fix required changes across layers (page + workflow + spec), validate ALL affected files

### Fail-Fast Conditions

- If a fix would violate any instruction rule → find an alternative fix
- If the fix requires `waitForTimeout` → STOP and find a web-first alternative
- If the fix requires hardcoded data → STOP and fix CSV/generator instead
- If the test logic is correct but environment is broken → `test.fixme()` with comment

---

## HEALING WORKFLOW

1. **Run** — use `test_run` to identify which tests are failing
2. **Debug** — use `test_debug` on each failing test individually
3. **Investigate** — use browser tools (snapshot, console, network) to observe live app state
4. **Root cause** — determine whether the failure is a selector, timing, data, or app change issue
5. **Fix** — edit code following centralized instruction rules
6. **Verify** — rerun until the test passes
7. **Iterate** — one issue at a time

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. Preserve the 3-layer architecture (Page Object + Workflow + Spec) in every fix
2. Check `pages/SF-Basepage/sf-page.ts` before creating any generic Salesforce method
3. Never introduce `waitForTimeout` — use web-first assertions only
4. Never hardcode test data to fix data-related failures — fix the CSV or generator instead
5. Always register records for cleanup after creation
6. Verify `try/catch/finally` pattern for toast + cleanup in specs
7. Verify `addLocatorHandler` with `{ noWaitAfter: true }` for duplicate detection + toast in `beforeEach`
8. Verify `captureScreenshot()` in page object catch blocks — errors wrapped with `throw new Error()`
9. Tags MUST be arrays inside `test()` with Jira key first — never fix tags into `test.describe()`
10. Never apply a fix you cannot explain from the root cause

---

## COMMON FIX PATTERNS

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `element not attached to DOM` | Cached locator after page transition | Convert to getter property — re-resolved on each access |
| Element not found | Missing `c-*` LWC scope or weak selector | Scope to `c-*` root; add `ResilientLocator` fallback strategies |
| Timeout / timing failure | No wait before interaction | Use `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` or wait for spinner hidden |
| Combobox won't select | Dropdown closed by overlay between click and option | Apply 3-attempt retry loop (see `.github/instructions/page-objects.instructions.md`) |
| Strict mode violation | Locator matches multiple elements | Add `exact: true`, `.filter({ hasText: /^text$/ })`, or parent scope |
| Click intercepted | Toast/spinner covering target | `addLocatorHandler` in spec `beforeEach` + spinner wait |
| Intermittent timeout | Long-running test, session expires | Apply session refresh middleware — see `.github/utilities/session-refresh-middleware.md` |
| Cleanup skipped | Toast error breaks flow | Wrap toast + cleanup in `try/catch/finally` — cleanup in `finally` |

## WHEN UNCERTAIN

- Read the failing file — auto-loaded instructions from `.github/instructions/` define the rules
- Check `.github/instructions/salesforce-stability.instructions.md` for failure pattern reference
